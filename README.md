# Sequential Stopwatch

A native iOS application for creating multiple stopwatches and playing them in a sequence. Stopwatches can be added, viewed in a list, and removed. Starting on the main screen will have each stopwatch play fully, vibrating after each completed stopwatch. The sequence cannot be edited while they are playing.
